SimpleGold v5.9.1

Description
===========
SimpleGold is a World of Warcraft AddOn.
Is creates a small, movable window showing your current money.
Mousing over the window displays a tooltip summary of the gold on all your alts.

Shift-clicking on the window will cycle through different background colors/transparencies.

Why would you want this?
You just want to keep an eye on your gold!
Perhaps you want to modify your interface - this provides a nice little money panel.

Why did _I_ make this?
Because I built a nice UI using assorted bar mods and panels. But I wanted a little money display. Now I have one!

Thanks to Sysop Meeanda for the color update for WoW Client 7.3.
